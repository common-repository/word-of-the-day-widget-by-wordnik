== Frequently Asked Questions ==



= Why don't you show pronunciations? =

We often have audio pronunciations available for our words of the day at [Wordnik.com](http://www.wordnik.com). Readers can click through to the main word page to hear the pronunciation


= I don't know any of these words! =

We work hard to select really rare and unusual words that most people will not have seen before -- we like to think we're giving these hidden gems new life. They are harder to work into your everyday vocabulary, but think how great you'll feel when you do?


= Can I suggest a word for your word of the day? =

Yes please! Email us at [feedback@wordnik.com](mailto:feedback@wordnik.com) with your suggestions. If we use it, we'll send you a Wordnik t-shirt!


= Can I choose a word from my blog post as the word of the day to display? =
